# gRPC between GoLang and Python

<h3>In this project I have created a simple gRPC transaction between 2 web servers, a GoLang based called <b>Fiber</b> and a Python based called <b>FastAPI</b>, this project's goal was for me to understand how intercommunication between microservices works, although this particular project does not implement a microservices paradigm it is a good and easy example of how to apply gRPC between any language. My choice of communication framework being gRPC is because after hours of research it is the most lightweight and low-latency communication framework as it relies on HTTP/2 which is a new http standard that not many frameworks support currently.
